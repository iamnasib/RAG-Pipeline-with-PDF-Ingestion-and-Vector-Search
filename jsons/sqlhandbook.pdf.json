Its a way to store data in a format that is easily accessible Example: Think of a library where books are organized by topic, author, and title \u2013 that\u2019s essentially what a database does with data. Why Do We Need Databases? \u2022 To store, manage, and retrieve large amounts of data efficiently. \u2022 To prevent data duplication and maintain data integrity. \u2022 To allow multiple users to access and manipulate data simultaneously. What is SQL? SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard programming language used to communicate with and manipulate databases. Common operations using SQL: \u2022 INSERT \u2013 Add new records (CREATE) \u2022 SELECT \u2013 Retrieve data (READ) \u2022 UPDATE \u2013 Modify existing data (UPDATE) \u2022 DELETE \u2013 Remove records (DELETE)"

Comparison with Excel Databases and Excel may seem similar at first, but they work differently under the hood. \u2022 In Excel, a sheet is like a table in a database. \u2022 Each row in the sheet is similar to a record (or entry) in a database table. \u2022 Each column in Excel corresponds to a field (or attribute) in a table. \u2022 Excel stores all data in one file, whereas a database can contain multiple related tables. \u2022 In databases, you can define strict data types and rules, which Excel doesn\u2019t enforce. \u2022 Unlike Excel, databases allow complex querying, relationships between tables, and secure multi-user access. Think of a database as a more powerful, structured, and scalable version of Excel for data management. Relational vs Non-relational Databases Relational databases store data in structured tables with predefined schemas and relationships between tables (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). Non-relational databases (NoSQL) use flexible formats like documents, key-value pairs, or graphs, and don\u2019t require a fixed schema (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase). Relational is ideal for structured data and complex queries, while non-relational is better for scalability and unstructured data.

A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL statements that are executed as a single unit.

The HAVING Clause Once you\u2019ve grouped data using GROUP BY , you might want to filter the groups themselves based on the result of an aggregate function. This is where HAVING comes in. HAVING is like WHERE , but it works after the grouping is done. Example: Departments with more than 5 employees SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT(*) > 5; We are telling MySQL: \u201cFirst group employees by department, then only show those departments where the total number is greater than 5.\u201d"

            "text": "Difference Between WHERE and HAVING Clause Used For Example Use WHERE Filters rows before grouping WHERE salary > 50000 HAVIN HAVING AVG(salary) > Filters groups after grouping G 60000 You can also use both together: SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees WHERE status = 'active' GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000; Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: 1. WHERE filters only the active employees. 2. GROUP BY groups them by department. 3. HAVING filters out departments with low average salary. Using WITH ROLLUP in MySQL The WITH ROLLUP clause in MySQL is used with GROUP BY to add summary rows (totals and subtotals) to your result set. Summary Keyword Role GROUP BY Groups rows with same values into summary rows HAVING Filters groups based on aggregate results"

            "text": "Stored Procedures in MySQL A Stored Procedure is a saved block of SQL code that you can execute later by calling its name. It allows you to group SQL statements and reuse them\u2014just like a function in programming. Why Use Stored Procedures? \u2022 To avoid repeating the same SQL logic in multiple places \u2022 To improve performance by reducing network traffic \u2022 To encapsulate complex business logic inside the database Creating a Stored Procedure When you create a stored procedure, you need to temporarily change the SQL statement delimiter from ; to something else like // or $$ . Why change the DELIMITER ? MySQL ends a command at the first ; . Since stored procedures contain multiple SQL statements (each ending in ; ), we need to tell MySQL not to end the procedure too early. So we temporarily change the delimiter to something else\u2014then switch it back."
