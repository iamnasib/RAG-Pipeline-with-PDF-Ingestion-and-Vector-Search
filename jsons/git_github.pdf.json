Definition: Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so you can recall specific versions later. It\u2019s like a time machine for your code. Why use it? \u2022 Tracks changes over time. \u2022 Restores older versions when something breaks. \u2022 Allows multiple people to work on the same project. \u2022 Helps experiment safely. The problem without version control: index.html index_final.html index_final_final.html index_final_v2_really_final.html This is messy, error-prone, and hard to manage. Centralized vs Distributed Version Control \u2022 Centralized (CVCS) \u2013 e.g., SVN \u2022 One central server stores the code. \u2022 If the server goes down, no one can commit changes.

What is Git? \u2022 Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) in 2005. \u2022 Git tracks changes in your files, especially source code. \u2022 Works locally first and then syncs with remote repositories. Git vs GitHub \u2022 Git \u2192 The tool that manages your code history (installed on your computer). \u2022 GitHub \u2192 A hosting service for Git repositories (like Google Drive for your Git projects). Also alternatives: GitLab, Bitbucket. Installing Git Windows 1. Go to https://git-scm.com/. 2. Download the installer. 3.
