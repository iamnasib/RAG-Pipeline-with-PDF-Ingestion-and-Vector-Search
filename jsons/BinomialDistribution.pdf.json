            "text": "What is the Binomial Distribution? The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent yes/no experiments, where each has the same probability of success. Think of this: \u2022 Toss a coin 10 times \u2022 What\u2019s the probability of getting exactly 6 heads? That\u2019s a binomial problem. Key Ingredients: \u2022 n = number of trials (e.g., 10 tosses) \u2022 p = probability of success (e.g., 0.5 for heads) \u2022 x = number of successes (e.g., 6 heads) Plain Text Formula: P(X = x) = C(n, x) \u00d7 p^x \u00d7 (1 - p)^(n - x) Where: \u2022 C(n, x) is \u201cn choose x\u201d = combinations = number of ways to pick x successes out of n \u2022 p^x is the probability of x successes \u2022 (1 - p)^(n - x) is the probability of the remaining being failures"

In Python: from scipy.stats import binom # Probability of exactly 6 heads in 10 tosses (p = 0.5) prob = binom.pmf(k=6, n=10, p=0.5) print(prob) # Output: ~0.205 When to Use: \u2022 Email campaign: Will 40 out of 100 people click the link? \u2022 Quality check: How many out of 10 products will be defective? \u2022 A/B testing: Will 60 out of 200 visitors convert?
