            "text": "Coders of Delhi Welcome - Your Data Science Internship begins Congratulations! You have just been hired as a Data Scientist Intern at CodeBook \u2013 The Social Media for Coders. This Delhi-based company is offering you a \u20b910 LPA job if you successfully complete this 1-month internship. But before you get there, you must prove your skills using only Python\u2014no pandas, NumPy, or fancy libraries! Your manager Puneet Kumar has assigned you your first task: analyzing a data dump of CodeBook users using pure Python. Your job is to load and explore the data to understand its structure. Task 1: Load the User Data Your manager has given you a dataset containing information about CodeBook users, their connections (friends), and the pages they have liked. This is how the data will look (in JSON format): { \"users\": [ {\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Amit\", \"friends\": [2, 3], \"liked_pages\": [101]}, {\"id\": 2, \"name\": \"Priya\", \"friends\": [1, 4], \"liked_pages\": [102]}, {\"id\": 3, \"name\": \"Rahul\", \"friends\": [1], \"liked_pages\": [101, 103]}, {\"id\": 4, \"name\": \"Sara\", \"friends\": [2], \"liked_pages\": [104]} ], \"pages\": [ {\"id\": 101, \"name\": \"Python Developers\"}, {\"id\": 102, \"name\": \"Data Science Enthusiasts\"}, {\"id\": 103, \"name\": \"AI & ML Community\"}, {\"id\": 104, \"name\": \"Web Dev Hub\"}"

            "text": "] } We have to read this data and understand its structure. The data contains three main components: 1. Users: Each user has an ID, name, a list of friends (by their IDs), and a list of liked pages (by their IDs). 2. Pages: Each page has an ID and a name. 3. Connections: Users can have multiple friends and can like multiple pages. Task 2: Read and Display the Data using Python Your goal is to load this data and print it in a structured way. Use Python\u2019s built-in modules to accomplish this. Steps: 1. Save the JSON data in a file ( codebook_data.json ). 2. Read the JSON file using Python. 3. Print user details and their connections. 4. Print available pages. Code Implementation Here\u2019s a simple way to load and display the data: import json # Load the JSON file def load_data(filename): with open(filename, \"r\") as file: data = json.load(file) return data # Display users and their connections def display_users(data): print(\"Users and Their Connections:\\n\") for user in data[\"users\"]:"

In social networks, this feature helps users connect with others by suggesting friends based on mutual connections. Your job is to analyze mutual friends and recommend potential connections. Task 1: Understand the Logic How \u2018People You May Know\u2019 Works: \u2022 If User A and User B are not friends but have mutual friends, we suggest User B to User A and vice versa. \u2022 More mutual friends = higher priority recommendation. Example: \u2022 Amit (ID: 1) is friends with Priya (ID: 2) and Rahul (ID: 3). \u2022 Priya (ID: 2) is friends with Sara (ID: 4). \u2022 Amit is not directly friends with Sara, but they share Priya as a mutual friend. \u2022 Suggest Sara to Amit as \u201cPeople You May Know\u201d. But there are cases where we will have more than one \u201cPeople You May Know\u201d. In those cases, greater the number of mutual friends, higher the probability that the user might know the person we are recommending. Task 2: Implement the Algorithm We\u2019ll create a function that: 1. Finds all friends of a given user. 2. Identifies mutual friends between non-friends. 3. Ranks recommendations by the number of mutual friends."

Finding \u201cPages You Might Like\u201d We\u2019ve officially reached the final milestone of our first data science project at CodeBook \u2013 The Social Media for Coders. After cleaning messy data and building features like People You May Know, it\u2019s time to launch our last feature: Pages You Might Like. Why This Matters In real-world social networks, content discovery keeps users engaged. This feature simulates that experience using nothing but pure Python, showing how even simple logic can power impactful insights. So now the situation is that your manager is impressed with your \u2018People You May Know\u2019 feature and now assigns you a new challenge: Recommend pages that users might like! On social media platforms, users interact with pages by liking, following, or engaging with posts. The goal is to analyze these interactions and suggest relevant pages based on user behavior."

Example: \u2022 Amit (ID: 1) likes Python Hub (Page ID: 101) and AI World (Page ID: 102). \u2022 Priya (ID: 2) likes AI World (Page ID: 102) and Data Science Daily (Page ID: 103). \u2022 Since Amit and Priya both like AI World (102), we suggest Data Science Daily (103) to Amit and Python Hub (101) to Priya. What we are using here is called collaborative filtering: \u201cIf two people like the same thing, maybe they\u2019ll like other things each one likes too.\u201d This is a basic form of a real-world recommendation engine, and our task is to implement it in pure Python.

Now this was a very simple case, there is a chance that two users like 10 pages each, in that case all the pages liked by user 1 will be recommended to user 2 and vice versa. The score of this recommendation is the number of common pages they like Conclusion In simple terms, if two users like some of the same pages, it\u2019s likely they share similar interests. So, pages liked by one can be recommended to the other. To make these recommendations smarter, we assign a similarity score \u2014 the number of pages they both like. The higher the score, the stronger the connection. In larger networks where users follow many pages, this score helps us prioritize and personalize suggestions, just like how platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn recommend content or connections. And that\u2019s a wrap! From loading and cleaning data to recommending people and pages, you\u2019ve successfully completed your first end-to-end data project using raw Python. Your manager is impressed. Your \u20b910 LPA dream offer letter is waiting for you!"
