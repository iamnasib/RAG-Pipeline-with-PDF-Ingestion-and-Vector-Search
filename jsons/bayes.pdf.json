            "text": "Bayes\u2019 Theorem Bayes\u2019 Theorem is written as: P(A / B) = [P(B / A) * P(A)] / P(B) where: \u2022 P(A / B) is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred. \u2022 P(B / A) is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has occurred. \u2022 P(A) is the prior probability of event A. This can also be interpreted as: P(A / B) = [P(B / A) * P(A)] / [P(B / A) * P(A) + P(B / No A) * P(No A)] It calculates the probability of event A given that event B has occurred, using the known conditional probability of B given A. Proof of Bayes\u2019 Theorem We start with the definition of conditional probability: 1. P(A / B) = P(A and B) / P(B) 2. P(B / A) = P(A and B) / P(A) From equation (2), we can write: P(A and B) = P(B / A) * P(A) Now substitute this into equation (1): P(A / B) = [P(B / A) * P(A)] / P(B)"

            "text": "This is Bayes\u2019 Theorem. Example: Medical Test Problem Suppose a disease affects 1% of the population. A test for the disease has the following characteristics: \u2022 If a person has the disease, the test is positive 99% of the time \u2192 P(Positive / Disease) = 0.99 \u2022 If a person does not have the disease, the test is positive 5% of the time \u2192 P(Positive / No Disease) = 0.05 \u2022 The chance of having the disease \u2192 P(Disease) = 0.01 \u2022 The chance of not having the disease \u2192 P(No Disease) = 0.99 A person takes the test and gets a positive result. What is the probability they actually have the disease? Let: \u2022 A = Disease \u2022 B = Positive test We apply Bayes\u2019 Theorem: P(Disease / Positive) = [P(Positive / Disease) * P(Disease)] / P(Positive) First, calculate P(Positive): P(Positive) = P(Positive / Disease) * P(Disease) + P(Positive / No Disease) * P(No Disease) P(Positive) = 0.99 * 0.01 + 0.05 * 0.99 P(Positive) = 0.0099 + 0.0495 = 0.0594 Now calculate P(Disease / Positive): P(Disease / Positive) = 0.0099 / 0.0594 \u2248 0.1667"
