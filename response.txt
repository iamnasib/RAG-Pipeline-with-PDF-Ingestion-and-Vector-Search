Conditional probability is the probability of an event A occurring given that another event B has already occurred. It helps us update our understanding based on new information. It is denoted as:

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

This is read as "The probability of A given B."

For a detailed explanation, you can refer to the file "Probability.pdf" on page 12, where conditional probability is introduced intuitively.
