Conditional probability is the probability of an event A occurring, given that another event B has already occurred. It helps us update our understanding based on new information. We denote it as: P(A/B) = P(A and B) / P(B) This is read as: “The probability of A given B.” Law of Total Probability The Law of Total Probability helps you find the probability of an event A by breaking it down based on other known events B1 , B2 , …, Bn . Formula: P(A) = P(A/B1) * P(B1) + P(A/B2) * P(B2) + … + P(A/Bn) * P(Bn) Conditions to Use This Law: 1. Partition of the Sample Space The events B1 , B2 , …, Bn must: 1. Be mutually exclusive (no overlap): No two events can happen at the same time.|
 File Name: bayes.pdf, Page Number: 1, Text: Bayes’ Theorem Bayes’ Theorem is written as: P(A / B) = [P(B / A) * P(A)] / P(B) where: • P(A / B) is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred. • P(B / A) is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has occurred. • P(A) is the prior probability of event A. This can also be interpreted as: P(A / B) = [P(B / A) * P(A)] / [P(B / A) * P(A) + P(B / No A) * P(No A)] It calculates the probability of event A given that event B has occurred, using the known conditional probability of B given A. Proof of Bayes’ Theorem We start with the definition of conditional probability: 1. P(A / B) = P(A and B) / P(B) 2. P(B / A) = P(A and B) / P(A) From equation (2), we can write: P(A and B) = P(B / A) * P(A) Now substitute this into equation (1): P(A / B) = [P(B / A) * P(A)] / P(B)|

 File Name: Probability.pdf, Page Number: 6, Text: Basic Rules of Probability 1. Important Definitions In probability, understanding the basic definitions is crucial for grasping more complex concepts. • Experiment: An action or process that leads to one or more outcomes (e.g., rolling a die). Deterministic experiments have predictable outcomes, while probabilistic or random experiments have uncertain outcomes. • Outcome: A possible result of an experiment (e.g., rolling a 3 on a die). • Probability (P): A measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain). • P(AUB): The probability of event A or event B occurring. • P(A∩B): The probability of both events A and B occurring. • Sample Space (S): The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. • Event (E): A subset of the sample space. • Mutually Exclusive Events: Two events that cannot occur at the same time (e.g., rolling a 2 and rolling a 5 on a die). P(A∩B)=0 • Independent Events: Two events where the occurrence of one does not affect the other. P(A∩B)=P(A)⋅P(B) • Certain Event: An event that is guaranteed to happen, with a probability of 1. • Impossible Event: An event that cannot happen, with a probability of 0. • Exhaustive Events: A set of events that cover the entire sample space, meaning at least one of them must occur.
